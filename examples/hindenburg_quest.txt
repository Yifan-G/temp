Where did the fire actually begin?
Why did two tanks burst out of the hull?
What was lost on the stern of the ship?
What came out of the nose as the tail of the Hinderberg crashed into the ground?
Why did the ship continue to point upward as the stern collapsed down?
What was erased by flames as the bow descended?
